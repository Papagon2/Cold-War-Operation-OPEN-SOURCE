Done with the cooperation with chatGPT.
No MIST or MOOSE is used yet. But been told is better to use them. feel free to particitate.
Please read ToDo.txt and Usage.txt!

THE MISSION IS NOT FINISHED!. But should be so many opertuneties to complete it.


Right now GROUND.lua is the main issue. Ground units have no waypoint or correct waypoint.

MAIN GOAL:

- Make it easy for setting up mission on any maps.
Means:
  The only thing you need to do:
    - Place Trigger Zones in the ME.
    - Write down all the Airfields you want to use in the mission.
    - Load triggers "DO SCRIPT FILE" in correct order.
    - PLAY.
